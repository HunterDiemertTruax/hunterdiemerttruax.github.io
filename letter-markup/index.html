<h2>Subjects of study</h2>

<p>
At the <strong>Awesome Science Faculty</strong>, we have a pretty open-minded research
facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.
You seem like an intelligent and driven candidate, and we are confident you would fit in
well here.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
    (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding
    30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the audience size exponentially increases
    (effectively 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup>)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

<p>

exotic dance styles from around the world, including:
</p>

  <li>Tango</li>
  <li>Flamenco</li>
</ol>
